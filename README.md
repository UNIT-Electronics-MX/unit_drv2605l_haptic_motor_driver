# DevLab: I2C DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller Module

## Introduction

The **DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller Module** is a compact, easy-to-use board designed to provide high-quality haptic feedback for a wide range of applications. At its core is the DRV2605L IC from Texas Instruments, a highly integrated haptic driver that supports both Linear Resonance Actuators (LRA) and Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) motors. This module enables precise and programmable vibration effects, making it ideal for wearables, handheld devices, robotics, and user interface prototyping.

Key features include:
- **I2C Interface:** Simple integration with microcontrollers and single-board computers.
- **Wide Voltage Range:** Operates from 3.3V to 5V, compatible with most development platforms.
- **Plug-and-Play Connectors:** 1mm JST connectors compatible with QWIIC and STEMMA QT ecosystems for rapid prototyping.
- **Advanced Haptic Effects:** Built-in library of vibration patterns and real-time playback support.
- **Open Source Support:** Example code and drivers available for Arduino, MicroPython, and other platforms.

Whether you are developing tactile feedback for a wearable device, enhancing a gaming controller, or adding intuitive notifications to your project, this module provides a reliable and flexible solution for integrating haptics into your designs.
